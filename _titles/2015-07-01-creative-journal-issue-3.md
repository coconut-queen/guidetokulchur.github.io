##from Holly Jensen's
**"Jean Dark"**


  > Backstage is the barrack before the battle,
  her hallmark a bitemark, my chignon a handle.
  Church had taught her how to sing,
  she grew the growl herself somewhere in the space
  between Him, the hymnal, and the hymn.
  Her pretty, gritty fluff tore in the wind,
  half cotton candy, half callous, cuff and collar.
  Like a goldfish, I grew to fit the walls of her gaze.
  She pierced her ears to please the earrings I bought her 
  as charms for storming the stage.
  I memorized the caress of love as it slithered through 
  my fingers like the feedback coda of her screamed psalms.
  One day I’ll know how to read people’s minds,
  but for now I’ll settle for their palms.

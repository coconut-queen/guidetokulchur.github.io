- from the poem, **Letter To Lucien (from James)**
> I thought of myself
a mentor
now it is clear that you carried me
village to village, children cooing - “Noire, Petite noire!”
Even a you loved women
even as I fell aside alleys
as my fame rested, looming over your brilliant face
even as Malcolm rose
Martin swelled
and white becomes scorn
negro tilled himself black
I loved you.
even as Betty screamed,
and Jesse witnessed a King’s head explode concrete. 
as Rufus jumped Bridge
Cleaver rallied hate
I loved you.
Forty year run
last night of me, this physical plane so shifting before
going home on the last train
it’s your blue eyes that hold me
my lips cracking as I call your name.

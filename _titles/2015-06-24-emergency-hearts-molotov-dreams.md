> "When the crow caws, listen! These stories are about envisioning more than what most of us are are used to; connecting with, and within, more than we give lip service to, and coming to grips with danger and opportunities for liberation in the grip of the Monstrous Empire. He opens the hardened layers of pain & suffering in the faith that Love, beyond Che cliques, will carry us thru to the authentic total liberation and happiness we all deserve on the death ashes of Capitalism." 

** — Ashanti Alston, writer, speaker, former Black Panther and Institute for Anarchist Studies board member**

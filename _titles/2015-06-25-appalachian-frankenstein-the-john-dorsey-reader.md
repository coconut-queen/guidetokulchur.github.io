##From Appalachian Frankenstein-

**Excerpt from the poem icarus revisited**

    an outsider in 
                       his 
                       own heart
    blowing unrequited kisses 
                       at the pavement
    
    where ex-lovers looked like ants
    swooning to a silent ballet
    only he knew the words to
    
    making beautiful music
    composing his melody 
                       in blood.
                 
### Praise for John Dorsey

When I teach the poems of John Dorsey to my students, they almost universally say, “yes.” Through their largely young eyes, I try to imagine what part of the universe Dorsey has touched within them. For years now I’ve been trying to figure out the same thing for myself as over, and over again, I come back to Dorsey’s collections hoping there’s one I’ve missed…as if the poems have grown up and had children between the pages and new words lay there just waking up. I am never disappointed. Dorsey’s poems reinvent themselves for us every time we read them. That is what my students see – they see themselves, both past and future. I seem to always see myself in his present. 
**-D.E. Oprava**

### from Sharif Shakhsir's 
**"Waffle Iron Becomes a Man"**

Sitting in among other electronic corpses, the waffle iron was visited by Mom’s spirit. “You didn’t deserve this,” she said, “and I will take responsibility. You may have one wish—”

“I want to know what it’s like to sit at the table,” the waffle iron interrupted.

“That’s a bit complicated. I can’t just put you at a table. What it’s like for a human to be at a table would be much different than what it would be like for a waffle iron to be at a table, but if I turn you into a person you could sit at a table whenever you want.”

The waffle maker agreed with her logic.

“I just have one question,” Mom’s spirit asked, “Are you a boy or a girl?”

The waffle iron had no idea how to answer this.

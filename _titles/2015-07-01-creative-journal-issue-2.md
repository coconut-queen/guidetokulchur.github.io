##from Molly Fuller's
**"Death After the Apocalypse"**

I think back to our future together; our house, carefully chosen for its backyard, room for children, not yet conceived, our life together, built simply, yet with direction.      

I wonder if I can stand in front of your body, sprinkle the kerosene from the lamp we had used for camping, now stored in the two-car garage, over you, wrap you in a sheet from our bed, light a match from a book of matches that we got together from our favorite bar.  

These would be your final wishes, after all.  "Burn it to the ground," you said.

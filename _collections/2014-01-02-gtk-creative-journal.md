True to founder RA Washington's vision, GTK Creative celebrates emerging and marginalized voices and has been a place for writers and readers to come together in appreciation of each other. We publish stories and poems that make us think about who we are, our community, the world, and our place in it.

Each issue is curated and edited by Krystal Sierra and printed quarterly in limited, perfect-bound, hand-crafted editions of 300 by Guide To Kulchur Press.
